 Track game prices from Steam.
 
 Consists of a web crawler Spider that scrapes Game price data from Steam and stores it in a file.
 You can access this data via an endpoint developed in FastAPI.
 
 You can check the [Flutter App]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/swap-stack/game_price_checker_flutter)) that I've developed to interact with this enpoint and access this data.
